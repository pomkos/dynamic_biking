### How To

#### Step 1: Overview
This step initializes the `session_info.py` script. It will preview settings and length of each bike session, including as a bar graph.

1. Review results
1. Save dataframe as excel file (Required)
1. Save bar plot (optional)

#### Step 2a: Format all sessions
The purpose of this step is to get each bike session file ready for entropy analysis. Minor cleaning and column renaming is involved.

1. Review results
1. Edit `Start` and `End` in the sidebar as needed to minimize severe jumps in cadence until satisfied
1. Save plot (optional)
1. Save all sessions in one excel sheet (optional)
1. Save all sessions in separate excel sheets (Required)

#### Step 2b: Format per participant
If one session needs more specific formatting, it can be selected here. The same procedure applies as for Step 2a. 

#### Step 3: Entropy Calculation
Calculation is done using MatLab. This step contains instructions for setting up MatLab is included in this step

#### Step 4: View Results

Finishing step: merge entropy dataset with dataset from Step 2, and graph results
