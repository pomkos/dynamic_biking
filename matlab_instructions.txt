### Troubleshooting

In case the error below appears, click `add its folder to the MATLAB path` and run the script again

```
Building with 'MinGW64 Compiler (C)'.
MEX completed successfully.
'ApSamEn' is not found in the current folder or on the MATLAB path, but exists in:
    [FOLDER LOCATION]

Change the MATLAB current folder or add its folder to the MATLAB path.

Error in apsamen_cleaned (line 61)
         [ap(n,num),  sam(n,num)]  = ApSamEn(data1(N1:N2,num),2,0.2*std1(num),n);
```
